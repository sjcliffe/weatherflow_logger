# weatherflow_logger

A Python script that listens for [UDP broadcast events](https://weatherflow.github.io/SmartWeather/api/udp.html) from a [WeatherFlow Smart Weather Station](http://weatherflow.com/smart-home-weather-stations/) and logs them to a file.

It also forwards (publishes) Weather observations via MQTT.
